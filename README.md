# Katie Mackenbrock Project 1

###### tags: `game, project 1, memory game, bravo housewives`

> A fun twist on your classic memory game, this will be a Bravo Housewives themed memory card game. Players will have to click on a grid of "cards", and each card will reveal one of our beloved Housewives. The player will then have to remember where that card was and try to find the matching one until the board is cleared. 
> 
> Ideally I will have a second, harder level to the game where there are significantly more cards and also a twist- the players match the old version of the housewife to the new version of that same housewife (it's no secret that these ladies' appearances have drastically changed throughout the years). 
> 
> ==It's important to note that I fully support all the plastic surgery things and am throwing no shade there. I love these ladies and their glowups. I think my fellow Bravoholics will get a good laugh.==

## :memo: Where do I start?

### Create README.md to lay everything out

- [x] Create README.md
- [ ] Ask to see some more beginner versions of successful games so I feel less intimidated :smile: 
- [ ] Try not to cry
 

### Tech to be used
- [ ] HTML
- [ ] CSS
- [ ] JavaScript
- [ ] TBD on whether I should use canvas or not, need to do more research

### Logical steps for JavaScript (I think)  :shrug:

- [ ] The game must shuffle cards at the start (shuffle array?)
- [ ] The game needs to know what to do with matched and unmatched cards
- [ ] The game should count the amount of moves the player makes and give a better score rating the lower the count
- [ ] In order to make the game "losable", I think I should make the goal to get it in under X amount of moves?
- [ ] I'm going to try to create a timer that starts when the first card is clicked and stops when the game is won to track players' times (we know this is going to be a *super* in-demand and competitive game and people will want to beat their high scores...)
- [ ] Do I want a reset button to clear the board/rating? I need to figure out how to make a reset button for just the clearBoard function I plan on writing but that still keeps track of the score if they want.
- [ ] Game should have a pop up alert (something funny with a classic HW image) to let the player know that they won/lost.

> Here is one picture of some of my favorite ladies :heart: (minus you, Candiace...)

### Wire Frames

- [ ] Initial wire framing of game http://framebox.org/AnIcy

### MVP Goals

### Stretch Goals

- [ ] Add audio with the housewives theme music, potentially a sound bite of a funny classic housewife line when the user wins/loses
