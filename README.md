# Katie Mackenbrock Project 1

###### tags: `game, project 1, memory game, bravo housewives`

> A fun twist on your classic memory game, this will be a Bravo Housewives themed memory card game. Players will have to click on a grid of "cards", and each card will reveal one of our beloved Housewives. The player will then have to remember where that card was and try to find the matching one until the board is cleared. 
> 
> Ideally I will have a second, harder level to the game where there are significantly more cards and also a twist- the players match the old version of the housewife to the new version of that same housewife (it's no secret that these ladies' appearances have drastically changed throughout the years). 
> 
> ==It's important to note that I fully support all the plastic surgery things and am throwing no shade there. I love these ladies and their glowups. I think my fellow Bravoholics will get a good laugh.==

## :memo: Where do I start?

### Create README.md to lay everything out

- [x] Create README.md
- [x] Ask to see some more beginner versions of successful games so I feel less intimidated :smile: 
- [ ] Try not to cry
 

### Tech to be used
- [x] HTML
- [x] CSS
- [x] JavaScript

### Logical steps for JavaScript (I think)  :shrug:

- [ ] The game must shuffle cards at the start (shuffle array?)
- [ ] The game needs to know what to do with matched and unmatched cards using checkForMatch function
- [ ] The game should count the amount of moves the player makes with a <span> moves counter
- [ ] A reset button should reload the page (with location.reload inside an event listener)
- [ ] Game should have a pop up alert/modal (something funny with a classic HW image) to let the player know that they picked a match, picked a mismatch
- [ ] Game should have a function to check the winning conditions...if matches === 8, set up a new alert/modal to congratulate the player

### Wire Frames

- [x] http://framebox.org/AnIcy

### MVP Goals
- [x] Let's get a semi-attractive and fully functional game board in here
- [x] Cards must be flippable. They must stay flipped over if they are a match, and automatically flip back if they are a mismatch
- [ ] This game needs a win condition to be able to tell if all the cards have been matched with an alert/modal pop up
- [ ] Let's make sure the modals look fly, too!

### Stretch Goals

- [ ] Add audio clip of RHOSLC theme as background music
- [ ] Add a level 2 where you match the pre-plastic surgery face to the post-plastic surgery face
- [ ] Add a rating/scoring system (eg. if you clear the board in under 15 moves, you get 3 crowns. Under 20 moves, 2 crowns. Under 25 moves, 1 crown.)
